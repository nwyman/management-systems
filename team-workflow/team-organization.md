# Team Organization

This is assuming a structure suited for Agile Scrum. I have found that to be a good balance of flexibility and structure to get to a high performing team.

  - Developers (minimum of 3, maximum of 7)
  - Tech Lead 
  - Scrum Master
  - Product Owner
  - QA

### Optional/Shared Resources
