# 1x1's

The basic idea with 1x1s is that you want your direct report to lead the conversation of the meeting, so they get to discuss what is important to them. This is their chance to let us as managers know what they are experiencing/feeling.

## Basic Setup

### Schedule
  - For new relationships and newer direct reports, once a week is a good cadence.
  - Once a direct report is firmly established or is of a more senior level role, moving up to a everything other week is OK.
  - 1x1s should be done every other week, at a minimum.
  - Length of meeting should be anywhere between 30 minutes to 1 hour. Use your intuition to determine how long it should be (junior emoployees need more time, or senior employees looking to be promotion need more coaching, etc).

## What to ask
  There are a couple high level areas you want to cover, maybe not all in a single 1x1, but on a rotation. 
  - How they are doing with their goals.
  - How they are feeling with the project/team/company.
  - Is there any friction/blockers that you as a manager can help with.
  - Coaching, performance evaluation, etc.

### What a 1x1 should \*not\* be
- A status update. Get this information from other avenues (i.e. stand-ups, status meetings, etc.)
- A therapy session. A little venting is OK, but you are not your direct report's therapist
