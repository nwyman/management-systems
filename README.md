# Management Systems

## Intro

This repo is meant to serve as a respository of all the systems I have developed over my time as a manager in the Software Engineering department. Some of these systems are personal to how I do work, and others are scoped to the team/department as a whole.

This is a living document, and will grow at a slow, but hopefully steady pace.
