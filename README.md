# Management Systems

## Intro

This repo is meant to serve as a respository of all the systems I have developed over my time as a manager in the Software Engineering department. Some of these systems are personal to how I do work, and others are scoped to the team/department as a whole.

It is broken up into the following sections:

1. [People Management](./people-management)
2. Team Workflows
3. Software Design & Architecture
4. Code Management
5. Resources
